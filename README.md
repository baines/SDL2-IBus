This repo doesn't keep up with the official SDL2 hg repository, it's just a 
public place for me to store my IBus IME patches.

These patches have now been accepted into the official SDL2 repo, so you should
download SDL2 from https://www.libsdl.org/hg.php instead of here to get all the
other newest changes as well as IBus IME support.
